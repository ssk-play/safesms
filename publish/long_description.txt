Kids SMS - Safe Messaging

THE STORY

This app was born from a real parenting challenge. I use Family Link to manage my children's screen time, but SMS and phone apps must always be accessible for emergencies. However, I discovered that links in text messages could open web browsers, completely bypassing the time restrictions.

When I announced I would create an SMS app that blocks all links, my daughter declared: "Dad, if you make that app, I will definitely find a way to break it!"

My response: "Oh really? Let's see if you can!"

This friendly challenge drives me to build the most secure link-blocking SMS app possible. If any issues are discovered, I'm committed to fixing them quickly.

Kids SMS - built by a parent, tested by determined kids, made stronger every day.

üõ°Ô∏è LINK BLOCKING

Traditional SMS apps make every URL, phone number, and address clickable - turning a simple message into a gateway to endless distractions. Kids SMS solves this:

‚Ä¢ ALL links are disabled in messages
‚Ä¢ No clickable URLs, phone numbers, or addresses
‚Ä¢ Kids can't browse the web from messages
‚Ä¢ Pure text communication only

üì± CORE FEATURES

‚Ä¢ Send and receive text messages
‚Ä¢ Threaded conversation view
‚Ä¢ Message notifications with Quick Reply
‚Ä¢ No ads, no tracking, no data collection

Great for:
‚Ä¢ First phone for elementary/middle school students
‚Ä¢ Distraction-free messaging during homework hours
‚Ä¢ Parental control without complex software
